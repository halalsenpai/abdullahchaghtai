          Hi, Iâ€˜m Abdullah, and I graduated from the University of Karachi in 2020 with a degree in Computer Science. My interests are in Front End Engineering, and I love
          to create beautiful and performant products with delightful user experiences. My interest in web development began when I was trying to do a crypto assignment and kinda
          went overkill with the frontend instead of making sure the ciphers came out right :)
          <div>Here are a few technologies I have experiences with:</div>
          <ul className="grid grid-cols-2">
            {Technologies.map((skill, i) => (
              <li key={i}>{skill}</li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="group relative w-[100%] h-[100% min-h-[300px] sm:min-h-[400px]  sm:min-w-[100%]">
